# Nim docs - generate a doc for any github nim project.

I got tried of building nim docs for all of my many projects. I create this site that auto generates the docs for me based on the url. Going to https://nimdocs.com/treeform/pixie will just clone the https://github.com/treeform/pixie and generate the docs with index for all files.

It is alpha quality, so if you want to be included in the allowed authors list, open a pull request.

## Features:

* Check if the docs are up to date with git.
* Clone new repositories if one just goes to them.
* Add source links back to github.com.
* Generates docs for all files in the repo.
